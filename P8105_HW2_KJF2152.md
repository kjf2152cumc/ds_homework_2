```

# Problem 1

## Read & Clean

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude /
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable (the ifelse or case_match function may be useful).

``` r
mta = 
  read_csv("Data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
           show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()


 mta_clean = 
   mta |> 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11 ,
         entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |> 
    mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) |> 
    mutate(across(route1:route11, as.character)) 
```

## Tidy Data?

Write a short paragraph about this dataset – explain briefly what
variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so
far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset.
Are these data tidy?

``` r
nrow(mta_clean)
```

    ## [1] 1868

``` r
ncol(mta_clean)
```

    ## [1] 19

``` r
head(mta_clean)

The initial dataset (which I nicknamed “mta” in my original dataframe)
had 1868 rows and 32 columns. I created a new dataframe called
“mta_clean” which used mta, kept the assigned variables, and turned the
“entry” variable into a logical variable. In this new dataset there are
1868 rows and 19 columns. The way that route is recorded is not tidy. I
think it would make more sense to have a column for route that assigned
one route name per row (so each entry would probably have mutiple rows).
I was going to make it longer now; however, doing so would make it more
difficult to answer a question about proportion of entrances with
vending below.

## Investigate

How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are identified
both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st Broadway;
125st Lenox); the distinct function may be useful here.

**There are 465 distinct stations.**

``` r
num_distinct_stations =
  mta_clean |> 
  distinct(line, station_name) 

nrow(num_distinct_stations)
```

    ## [1] 465

How many stations are ADA compliant?

**84 stations are ADA compliant.**

``` r
num_ada_true =
  mta_clean |> 
  filter(ada == TRUE) |> 
  distinct(line, station_name) 

nrow(num_ada_true)
```

    ## [1] 84

What proportion of entrances without vending allow entrance?

**37.7% of the station entrances without vending allow entrance.**

``` r
prop =
  mta_clean |> 
  filter(vending == "NO") |> 
  summarise(proportion = sum(entry == TRUE) / n()) |> 
  pull(proportion)

prop
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train?

**60 distinct stations serve the A train.**

``` r
mta_longer = 
  mta_clean |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = route1:route11, 
    names_to = "route_var", 
    values_to = "route_name"
  ) |> 
  filter(!is.na(route_name)) |>   
  separate(
    route_var, 
    into = c("route_number", "route_prefix"), 
    sep = "route", 
    convert = TRUE  
  ) |> 
  select(-route_prefix) 

a_train =
  mta_longer |> 
  filter(route_name == "A") |> 
  distinct(line, station_name, ada) 

nrow(a_train)
```

    ## [1] 60

Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

**17 of the stations that serve the A train are ADA compliant.**

``` r
compliant = 
  a_train |> 
  filter(ada == TRUE) 

nrow(compliant)
```

# Problem 2

## Read & Clean

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

Specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
read_excel. Use reasonable variable names. Omit rows that do not include
dumpster-specific data. Round the number of sports balls to the nearest
integer and convert the result to an integer variable (using
as.integer).

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, and combine this with the Mr. Trash
Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep track of which
Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an additional variable to both
datasets before combining.

``` r
mr_df = 
  read_excel("Data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
    select(-c(x15, x16)) |> 
      na.omit() |> 
        mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) |> 
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel") |> 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...15`
    ## • `` -> `...16`

head(mr_df)

## Writing

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total
number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022?

The `mr_df` dataset had `nrow(mr_df)`observations, Professor Trash Wheel
`nrow(prof_df)` and Gwynnda `nrow(gwynn)`. There are `nrow(merged_df)`
observations in the joined dataset `merged_df` which is equivalent to
the sum of the observations in the three datasets. See `num` above.
There are 15 columns including date of dumpster recording, the dumpster
number for each specific trash wheel, tons of trash collected per
collection time, and weights of various different types of waste. For
example, Professor Trash Wheel collected `prof_trash_weight` tons of
trash and Gwynnda collected `cigs_june_gwyn` cigarette butts in June of
2022.

``` r
prof_trash_weight=
  merged_df |> 
  filter(trash_wheel == "Prof. Trash Wheel")  |> 
  summarise(total_weight_tons = sum(weight_tons, na.rm = TRUE))

cigs_june_gwyn=
  merged_df |> 
  filter(trash_wheel == "Gwynnda", month == "June", year == 2022) |> 
  nrow()

# Problem 3

This problem uses data on elements of the Great British Bake Off. The
show has been running for 10 seasons; in each episode, contestants
compete in signature challenges, technical challenges, and a
showstopper. At the end of an episode the winner is crowned “Star Baker”
(and winner in the last episode of a season), and a loser is eliminated.

Information about individual bakers, their bakes, and their performance
is included in bakers.csv, bakes.csv, and results.csv. In the first part
of this problem, your goal is to create a single, well-organized dataset
with all the information contained in these data files. To that end:
import, clean, tidy, and otherwise wrangle each of these datasets; check
for completeness and correctness across datasets (e.g. by viewing
individual datasets and using anti_join); merge to create a single,
final dataset; and organize this so that variables and observations are
in meaningful orders. Export the result as a CSV in the directory
containing the original datasets.

Describe your data cleaning process, including any questions you have or
choices you made. Briefly discuss the final dataset.

Create a reader-friendly table showing the star baker or winner of each
